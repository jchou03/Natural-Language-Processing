that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though , when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . </s>', '<s> \" how good it was in you , my dear mr. bennet ! </s>', '<s> but i knew i should persuade you at last . </s>', '<s> i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . </s>', '<s> well , how pleased i am ! </s>', '<s> and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . \" </s>', '<s> \" now , kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , \" said mr. bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . </s>', '<s> \" what an excellent father you have , girls ! \" said she , when the door was shut . </s>', '<s> \" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter . </s>', '<s> at our time of life it is not so pleasant , i can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything . </s>', '<s> lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball . \" </s>', '<s> \" oh ! \" said lydia stoutly , \" i am not afraid ; for though i _ am _ the youngest , i \\'m the tallest . \" </s>', \"<s> the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennet 's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . </s>\", '<s> not all that mrs. bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject , was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley . </s>', '<s> they attacked him in various ways -- with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all , and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour , lady lucas . </s>', '<s> her report was highly favourable . </s>', '<s> sir william had been delighted with him . </s>', '<s> he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . </s>', '<s> nothing could be more delightful ! </s>', \"<s> to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr. bingley 's heart were entertained . </s>\", '<s> \" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , \" said mrs. bennet to her husband , \" and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for . \" </s>', \"<s> in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet 's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . </s>\", '<s> he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . </s>', '<s> the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat , and rode a black horse . </s>', '<s> an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . </s>', '<s> mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and , consequently , unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc . </s>', '<s> mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted . </s>', '<s> she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be . </s>', '<s> lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . </s>', '<s> the girls grieved over such a number of ladies , but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from london -- his five sisters and a cousin . </s>', '<s> and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether -- mr. bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . </s>', '<s> mr. bingley was good - looking and gentlemanlike ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . </s>', '<s> his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . </s>', '<s> his brother - in - law , mr. hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien , and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . </s>', '<s> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud ; to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . </s>', '<s> mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield . </s>', '<s> such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . </s>', '<s> what a contrast between him and his friend ! </s>', '<s> mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . </s>', '<s> his character was decided . </s>', '<s> he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again . </s>', '<s> amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters . </s>', '<s> elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr. bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . </s>', '<s> \" come , darcy , \" said he , \" i must have you dance . </s>', '<s> i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . </s>', '<s> you had much better dance . \" </s>', '<s> \" i certainly shall not . </s>', '<s> you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner . </s>', '<s> at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable . </s>', '<s> your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . \" </s>', '<s> \" i would not be so fastidious as you are , \" cried mr. bingley , \" for a kingdom ! </s>', '<s> upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . \" </s>', '<s> \" _ you _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , \" said mr. darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet . </s>', '<s> \" oh ! </s>', '<s> she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! </s>', '<s> but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say very agreeable . </s>', '<s> do let me ask my partner to introduce you . \" </s>', '<s> \" which do you mean ? \" and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said : \" she is tolerable , but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . </s>', '<s> you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . \" </s>', '<s> mr. bingley followed his advice . </s>', '<s> mr. darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him . </s>', '<s> she told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous . </s>', '<s> the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . </s>', '<s> mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party . </s>', '<s> mr. bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . </s>', '<s> jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . </s>', \"<s> elizabeth felt jane 's pleasure . </s>\", '<s> mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . </s>', '<s> they returned , therefore , in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . </s>', '<s> they found mr. bennet still up . </s>', '<s> with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . </s>', \"<s> he had rather hoped that his wife 's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear . </s>\", '<s> \" oh ! my dear mr. bennet , \" as she entered the room , \" we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . </s>', '<s> i wish you had been there . </s>', '<s> jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . </s>', '<s> everybody said how well she looked ; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice ! </s>', '<s> only think of _ that _ , my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ! </s>', '<s> and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . </s>', '<s> first of all , he asked miss lucas . </s>', '<s> i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ! </s>', '<s> but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance . </s>', '<s> so he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . </s>', '<s> then the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the _ boulanger_-- \" </s>', '<s> \" if he had had any compassion for _ me _ , \" cried her husband impatiently , \" he would not have danced half so much ! </s>', \"<s> for god 's sake , say no more of his partners . </s>\", '<s> o that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance ! \" </s>', '<s> \" oh ! my dear , i am quite delighted with him . </s>', '<s> he is so excessively handsome ! </s>', '<s> and his sisters are charming women . </s>', '<s> i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . </s>', '<s> i dare say the lace upon mrs. hurst \\'s gown-- \" </s>', '<s> here she was interrupted again . </s>', '<s> mr. bennet protested against any description of finery . </s>', '<s> she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy . </s>', '<s> \" but i can assure you , \" she added , \" that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . </s>', '<s> so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! </s>', '<s> he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! </s>', '<s> not handsome enough to dance with ! </s>', '<s> i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . </s>', '<s> i quite detest the man . \" </s>', '<s> when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before , expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him . </s>', '<s> \" he is just what a young man ought to be , \" said she , \" sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! \" </s>', '<s> \" he is also handsome , \" replied elizabeth , \" which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . </s>', '<s> his character is thereby complete . \" </s>', '<s> \" i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . </s>', '<s> i did not expect such a compliment . \" </s>', '<s> \" did not you ? </s>', '<s> i did for you . </s>', '<s> but that is one great difference between us . </s>', '<s> compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . </s>', '<s> what could be more natural than his asking you again ? </s>', '<s> he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . </s>', '<s> no thanks to his gallantry for that . </s>', '<s> well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him . </s>', '<s> you have liked many a stupider person . \" </s>', '<s> \" dear lizzy ! \" </s>', '<s> \" oh ! you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . </s>', '<s> you never see a fault in anybody . </s>', '<s> all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . </s>', '<s> i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life . \" </s>', '<s> \" i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but i always speak what i think . \" </s>', '<s> \" i know you do ; and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . </s>', '<s> with _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! </s>', '<s> affectation of candour is common enough -- one meets with it everywhere . </s>', \"<s> but to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of everybody 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone . </s>\", \"<s> and so you like this man 's sisters , too , do you ? </s>\", '<s> their manners are not equal to his . \" </s>', '<s> \" certainly not -- at first . </s>', '<s> but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . </s>', '<s> miss bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . </s>', '<s> they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it , but proud and conceited . </s>', '<s> they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank , and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . </s>', \"<s> they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother 's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . </s>\", '<s> mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . </s>', '<s> mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . </s>', '<s> his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but , though he was now only established as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table -- nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . </s>', '<s> mr. bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house . </s>', '<s> he did look at it , and into it for half - an - hour -- was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . </s>', '<s> between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of great opposition of character . </s>', '<s> bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . </s>', \"<s> on the strength of darcy 's regard , bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgement the highest opinion . </s>\", '<s> in understanding , darcy was the superior . </s>', '<s> bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever . </s>', '<s> he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well - bred , were not inviting . </s>', '<s> in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . </s>', '<s> bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offense . </s>', '<s> the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . </s>', '<s> bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life ; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ; there had been no formality , no stiffness ; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and , as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . </s>', '<s> darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . </s>', '<s> miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . </s>', '<s> mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they would not object to know more of . </s>', '<s> miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose . </s>', '<s> within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate . </s>', '<s> sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty . </s>', '<s> the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . </s>', '<s> it had given him a disgust to his business , and to his residence in a small market town ; and , in quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . </s>', '<s> for , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody . </s>', \"<s> by nature inoffensive , friendly , and obliging , his presentation at st. james 's had made him courteous . </s>\", '<s> lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet . </s>', '<s> they had several children . </s>', \"<s> the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was elizabeth 's intimate friend . </s>\", '<s> that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate . </s>', '<s> \" _ you _ began the evening well , charlotte , \" said mrs. bennet with civil self - command to miss lucas . </s>', '<s> \" _ you _ were mr. bingley \\'s first choice . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . \" </s>', '<s> \" oh ! you mean jane , i suppose , because he danced with her twice . </s>', '<s> to be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed i rather believe he _ did_--i heard something about it -- but i hardly know what -- something about mr. robinson . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson ; did not i mention it to you ? </s>', \"<s> mr. robinson 's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ </s>\", '<s> he thought the prettiest ? </s>', \"<s> and his answering immediately to the last question : ' oh ! </s>\", '<s> the eldest miss bennet , beyond a doubt ; there can not be two opinions on that point . \\' \" </s>', '<s> \" upon my word ! </s>', '<s> well , that is very decided indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . \" </s>', '<s> \" _ my _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , eliza , \" said charlotte . </s>', '<s> \" mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _ tolerable _ . \" </s>', '<s> \" i beg you would not put it into lizzy \\'s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man , that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . </s>', '<s> mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half - an - hour without once opening his lips . \" </s>', '<s> \" are you quite sure , ma\\'am?--is not there a little mistake ? \" said jane . </s>', '<s> \" i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her . \" </s>', '<s> \" aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to . \" </s>', '<s> \" miss bingley told me , \" said jane , \" that he never speaks much , unless among his intimate acquaintances . </s>', '<s> with _ them _ </s>', '<s> he is remarkably agreeable . \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not believe a word of it , my dear . </s>', '<s> if he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to mrs. long . </s>', '<s> but i can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long , \" said miss lucas , \" but i wish he had danced with eliza . \" </s>', '<s> \" another time , lizzy , \" said her mother , \" i would not dance with _ him _ , if i were you . \" </s>', '<s> \" i believe , ma\\'am , i may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . \" </s>', '<s> \" his pride , \" said miss lucas , \" does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . </s>', '<s> one can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . </s>', '<s> if i may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is very true , \" replied elizabeth , \" and i could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . \" </s>', '<s> \" pride , \" observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , \" is a very common failing , i believe . </s>', '<s> by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . </s>', '<s> vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . </s>', '<s> a person may be proud without being vain . </s>', '<s> pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . \" </s>', '<s> \" if i were as rich as mr. darcy , \" cried a young lucas , who came with his sisters , \" i should not care how proud i was . </s>', '<s> i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine a day . \" </s>', '<s> \" then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , \" said mrs. bennet ; \" and if i were to see you at it , i should take away your bottle directly . \" </s>', '<s> the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . </s>', '<s> the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield . </s>', '<s> the visit was soon returned in due form . </s>', \"<s> miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable , and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _ them _ was expressed towards the two eldest . </s>\", \"<s> by jane , this attention was received with the greatest pleasure , but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration . </s>\", '<s> it was generally evident whenever they met , that he _ did _ admire her and to _ her _ </s>', '<s> it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united , with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . </s>', '<s> she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas . </s>', '<s> \" it may perhaps be pleasant , \" replied charlotte , \" to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . </s>', '<s> if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . </s>', '<s> there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . </s>', '<s> we can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . </s>', '<s> in nine cases out of ten a women had better show _ more _ affection than she feels . </s>', '<s> bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . \" </s>', '<s> \" but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . </s>', '<s> if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton , indeed , not to discover it too . \" </s>', '<s> \" remember , eliza , that he does not know jane \\'s disposition as you do . \" </s>', '<s> \" but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . </s>', '<s> but , though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and , as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . </s>', '<s> jane should therefore make the most of every half - hour in which she can command his attention . </s>', '<s> when she is secure of him , there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . \" </s>', '<s> \" your plan is a good one , \" replied elizabeth , \" where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married , and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it . </s>', \"<s> but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design . </s>\", '<s> as yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness . </s>', '<s> she has known him only a fortnight . </s>', '<s> she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined with him in company four times . </s>', '<s> this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . \" </s>', '<s> \" not as you represent it . </s>', '<s> had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt - un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . \" </s>', '<s> \" well , \" said charlotte , \" i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . </s>', '<s> happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . </s>', '<s> if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . </s>', '<s> they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . \" </s>', '<s> \" you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound . </s>', '<s> you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . \" </s>', \"<s> occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . </s>\", '<s> mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . </s>', '<s> but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . </s>', '<s> to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . </s>', '<s> though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . </s>', '<s> of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . </s>', '<s> he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . </s>', '<s> his doing so drew her notice . </s>', \"<s> it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled . </s>\", '<s> \" what does mr. darcy mean , \" said she to charlotte , \" by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? \" </s>', '<s> \" that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer . \" </s>', '<s> \" but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about . </s>', '<s> he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . \" </s>', '<s> on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him ; which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said : </s>', '<s> \" did you not think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? \" </s>', '<s> \" with great energy ; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic . \" </s>', '<s> \" you are severe on us . \" </s>', '<s> \" it will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , \" said miss lucas . </s>', '<s> \" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . \" </s>', '<s> \" you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! </s>', '<s> if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . \" </s>', '<s> on miss lucas \\'s persevering , however , she added , \" very well , if it must be so , it must . \" </s>', '<s> and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , \" there is a fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with : \\' keep your breath to cool your porridge \\' ; and i shall keep mine to swell my song . \" </s>', '<s> her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . </s>', '<s> after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . </s>', '<s> mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . </s>', '<s> elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who , with some of the lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . </s>', '<s> mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began : </s>', '<s> \" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy ! </s>', '<s> there is nothing like dancing after all . </s>', '<s> i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society . \" </s>', '<s> \" certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world . </s>', '<s> every savage can dance . \" </s>', '<s> sir william only smiled . </s>', '<s> \" your friend performs delightfully , \" he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; \" and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr. darcy . \" </s>', '<s> \" you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . </s>', '<s> do you often dance at st. james \\'s ? \" </s>', '<s> \" never , sir . \" </s>', '<s> \" do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? \" </s>', '<s> \" it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . \" </s>', '<s> \" you have a house in town , i conclude ? \" </s>', '<s> mr. darcy bowed . </s>', '<s> \" i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself -- for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . \" </s>', '<s> he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her : </s>', '<s> \" my dear miss eliza , why are you not dancing ? </s>', '<s> mr. darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . </s>', '<s> you can not refuse to dance , i am sure when so much beauty is before you . \" </s>', '<s> and , taking her hand , he would have given it to mr. darcy who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william : </s>', '<s> \" indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing . </s>', '<s> i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner . \" </s>', '<s> mr. darcy , with grave propriety , requested to be allowed the honour of her hand , but in vain . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . </s>', '<s> \" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half - hour . \" </s>', '<s> \" mr. darcy is all politeness , \" said elizabeth , smiling . </s>', '<s> \" he is , indeed ;

their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . </s>\", '<s> at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the headquarters . </s>', '<s> their visits to mrs. phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence . </s>', \"<s> every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . </s>\", '<s> their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . </s>', '<s> mr. phillips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before . </s>', \"<s> they could talk of nothing but officers ;

the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ankles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . </s>\", '<s> she was shown into the breakfast - parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . </s>', '<s> that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . </s>', \"<s> she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother 's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . </s>\", '<s> mr. darcy said very little , and mr. hurst nothing at all . </s>', \"<s> the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion 's justifying her coming so far alone . </s>\", '<s> the latter was thinking only of his breakfast . </s>', '<s> her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . </s>', '<s> miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . </s>', '<s> she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . </s>', '<s> elizabeth silently attended her . </s>', '<s> when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane . </s>', '<s> the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . </s>', '<s> the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . </s>', '<s> elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment ; nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had , in fact , nothing to do elsewhere . </s>', '<s> when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go , and very unwillingly said so . </s>', '<s> miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present . </s>', '<s> elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes . </s>', \"<s> at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half - past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner . </s>\", \"<s> to the civil inquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingley 's , she could not make a very favourable answer . </s>\", '<s> jane was by no means better . </s>', '<s> the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike . </s>', '<s> their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . </s>', '<s> his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . </s>', '<s> she had very little notice from any but him . </s>', '<s> miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr. hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards ; who , when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . </s>', '<s> when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . </s>', '<s> her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no beauty . </s>', '<s> mrs. hurst thought the same , and added : </s>', '<s> \" she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . </s>', '<s> i shall never forget her appearance this morning . </s>', '<s> she really looked almost wild . \" </s>', '<s> \" she did , indeed , louisa . </s>', '<s> i could hardly keep my countenance . </s>', '<s> very nonsensical to come at all ! </s>', '<s> why must _ she _ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? </s>', '<s> her hair , so untidy , so blowsy ! \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . \" </s>', '<s> \" your picture may be very exact , louisa , \" said bingley ; \" but this was all lost upon me . </s>', '<s> i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . </s>', '<s> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . \" </s>', '<s> \" _ you _ observed it , mr. darcy , i am sure , \" said miss bingley ; \" and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your _ sister make such an exhibition . \" </s>', '<s> \" certainly not . \" </s>', '<s> \" to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ankles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! </s>', '<s> what could she mean by it ? </s>', '<s> it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . \" </s>', '<s> \" it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , \" said bingley . </s>', '<s> \" i am afraid , mr. darcy , \" observed miss bingley in a half whisper , \" that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . \" </s>', '<s> \" not at all , \" he replied ; \" they were brightened by the exercise . \" </s>', '<s> a short pause followed this speech , and mrs. hurst began again : </s>', '<s> \" i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled . </s>', '<s> but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it . \" </s>', '<s> \" i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on meryton . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is capital , \" added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . </s>', '<s> \" if they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ cheapside , \" cried bingley , \" it would not make them one jot less agreeable . \" </s>', '<s> \" but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , \" replied darcy . </s>', \"<s> to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend 's vulgar relations . </s>\", '<s> with a renewal of tenderness , however , they returned to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . </s>', '<s> she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep , and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself . </s>', '<s> on entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below , with a book . </s>', '<s> mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment . </s>', '<s> \" do you prefer reading to cards ? \" said he ; \" that is rather singular . \" </s>', '<s> \" miss eliza bennet </s>', '<s> , \" said miss bingley , \" despises cards . </s>', '<s> she is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . \" </s>', '<s> \" i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , \" cried elizabeth ; \" i am _ not _ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things . \" </s>', '<s> \" in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , \" said bingley ; \" and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying . </s>', '<s> he immediately offered to fetch her others -- all that his library afforded . </s>', '<s> \" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever looked into . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . </s>', '<s> \" i am astonished , \" said miss bingley , \" that my father should have left so small a collection of books . </s>', '<s> what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr. darcy ! \" </s>', '<s> \" it ought to be good , \" he replied , \" it has been the work of many generations . \" </s>', '<s> \" and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . \" </s>', '<s> \" i can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . \" </s>', '<s> \" neglect ! </s>', '<s> i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . </s>', '<s> charles , when you build _ your _ house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley . \" </s>', '<s> \" i wish it may . \" </s>', '<s> \" but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model . </s>', '<s> there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire . \" </s>', '<s> \" with all my heart ;

and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . </s>', '<s> \" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? \" said miss bingley ;

and soon afterwards mr. darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her : </s>', '<s> \" do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? \" </s>', '<s> she smiled , but made no answer . </s>', '<s> he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . </s>', '<s> \" oh ! \" said she , \" i heard you before , but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply . </s>', \"<s> you wanted me , i know , to say ' yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;

but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other ; of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr. denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant 's commission in the ----shire . </s>\", '<s> she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr. wickham appeared , kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become \" stupid , disagreeable fellows . \" </s>', '<s> some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr. wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening . </s>', '<s> this was agreed to , and mrs. phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . </s>', '<s> the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . </s>', '<s> mr. collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless . </s>', '<s> as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be in the wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . </s>', \"<s> mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. phillips 's manners and politeness . </s>\", '<s> he protested that , except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . </s>', '<s> something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . </s>', \"<s> as no objection was made to the young people 's engagement with their aunt , and all mr. collins 's scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle 's invitation , and was then in the house . </s>\", \"<s> when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs. phillips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor -- when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine 's drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper 's room . </s>\", '<s> in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs. phillips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . </s>', '<s> to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . </s>', '<s> it was over at last , however . </s>', '<s> the gentlemen did approach , and when mr. wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . </s>', '<s> the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable , gentlemanlike set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _ they _ were superior to the broad - faced , stuffy uncle phillips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . </s>', '<s> mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . </s>', '<s> with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers , mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. phillips , and was by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . </s>', '<s> when the card - tables were placed , he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn , by sitting down to whist . </s>', '<s> \" i know little of the game at present , \" said he , \" but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation in life-- \" mrs. phillips was very glad for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . </s>', '<s> mr. wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia . </s>', \"<s> at first there seemed danger of lydia 's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ;

but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry . </s>', '<s> mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . </s>', '<s> \" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , \" he added , \" which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire . </s>', '<s> i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them . </s>', '<s> society , i own , is necessary to me . </s>', '<s> i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . </s>', '<s> i _ must _ have employment and society . </s>', '<s> a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . </s>', '<s> the church _ ought _ to have been my profession -- i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . \" </s>', '<s> \" indeed ! \" </s>', '<s> \" yes -- the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . </s>', '<s> he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . </s>', '<s> i can not do justice to his kindness . </s>', '<s> he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ;

and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . </s>', '<s> but she is nothing to me now . </s>', '<s> she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , i understand , highly accomplished . </s>', '<s> since her father \\'s death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . \" </s>', '<s> after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying : </s>', '<s> \" i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley ! </s>', '<s> how can mr. bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? </s>', '<s> how can they suit each other ? </s>', '<s> do you know mr. bingley ? \" </s>', '<s> \" not at all . \" </s>', '<s> \" he is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . </s>', '<s> he can not know what mr. darcy is . \" </s>', '<s> \" probably not ;

but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable -- allowing something for fortune and figure . \" </s>', '<s> the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. phillips . </s>', '<s> the usual inquiries as to his success was made by the latter . </s>', '<s> it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs. phillips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged that she would not make herself uneasy . </s>', '<s> \" i know very well , madam , \" said he , \" that when persons sit down to a card - table , they must take their chances of these things , and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . </s>', '<s> there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . \" </s>', \"<s> mr. wickham 's attention was caught ; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh . </s>\", '<s> \" lady catherine de bourgh , \" she replied , \" has very lately given him a living . </s>', '<s> i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . \" </s>', '<s> \" you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ;

\" i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . </s>', '<s> she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride for her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . \" </s>', \"<s> elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together , with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham 's attentions . </s>\", \"<s> there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. phillips 's supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . </s>\", '<s> whatever he said , was said well ;

but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent . </s>', '<s> lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and mr. collins in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. phillips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house . </s>', '<s> elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr. wickham and herself . </s>', \"<s> jane listened with astonishment and concern ;

mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long - expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday . </s>', '<s> the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . </s>', '<s> to the rest of the family they paid little attention ;

and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcy 's look and behavior . </s>\", '<s> the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball . </s>', '<s> and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . </s>', '<s> \" while i can have my mornings to myself , \" said she , \" it is enough -- i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . </s>', '<s> society has claims on us all ;

and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance . </s>\", '<s> \" i am by no means of the opinion , i assure you , \" said he , \" that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ;

and to have mr. collins instead ! </s>', '<s> her liveliness had never been worse timed . </s>', '<s> there was no help for it , however . </s>', \"<s> mr. wickham 's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer , and mr. collins 's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . </s>\", '<s> she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more . </s>', '<s> it now first struck her , </s>', '<s> that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . </s>', '<s> the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _ her _ . </s>', '<s> elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . </s>', '<s> mr. collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . </s>', '<s> if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once . </s>', '<s> no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after -- the very shoe - roses for netherfield were got by proxy . </s>', '<s> even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday , and monday endurable to kitty and lydia . </s>', '<s> till elizabeth entered the drawing - room at netherfield , and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . </s>', '<s> the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . </s>', '<s> she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . </s>', '<s> but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy \\'s pleasure in the bingleys \\' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , \" i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here . \" </s>', \"<s> this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and , as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . </s>\", '<s> attendance , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham . </s>', '<s> she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill - humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . </s>', '<s> but elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . </s>', '<s> the first two dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . </s>', '<s> mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . </s>', '<s> the moment of her release from him was ecstasy . </s>', '<s> she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . </s>', '<s> when those dances were over , she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . </s>', '<s> he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her : </s>', '<s> \" i dare say you will find him very agreeable . \" </s>', '<s> \" heaven forbid ! </s>', '<s> _ </s>', '<s> that _ would be the greatest misfortune of all ! </s>', '<s> to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! </s>', '<s> do not wish me such an evil . \" </s>', '<s> when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence . </s>', \"<s> elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks , their equal amazement in beholding it . </s>\", '<s> they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . </s>', '<s> he replied , and was again silent . </s>', '<s> after a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time with:--\"it is _ your _ turn to say something now , mr. darcy . </s>', '<s> i talked about the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . \" </s>', '<s> he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . </s>', '<s> \" very well . </s>', '<s> that reply will do for the present . </s>', '<s> perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . </s>', '<s> but _ now _ we may be silent . \" </s>', '<s> \" do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? \" </s>', '<s> \" sometimes . </s>', '<s> one must speak a little , you know . </s>', '<s> it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ;

that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side ; and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . </s>', '<s> mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and , when she ceased speaking , replied thus : </s>', '<s> \" my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding ;

and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield . </s>', '<s> the next day opened a new scene at longbourn . </s>', '<s> mr. collins made his declaration in form . </s>', '<s> having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances , which he supposed a regular part of the business . </s>', '<s> on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words : </s>', '<s> \" may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? \" </s>', '<s> before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet answered instantly , \" oh dear!--yes -- certainly . </s>', '<s> i am sure lizzy will be very happy -- i am sure she can have no objection . </s>', '<s> come , kitty , i want you upstairs . \" </s>', '<s> and , gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out : </s>', '<s> \" dear madam , do not go . </s>', '<s> i beg you will not go . </s>', '<s> mr. collins must excuse me . </s>', '<s> he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . </s>', '<s> i am going away myself . \" </s>', '<s> \" no , no , nonsense , lizzy . </s>', '<s> i desire you to stay where you are . \" </s>', '<s> and upon elizabeth \\'s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added : \" lizzy , i _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing mr. collins . \" </s>', \"<s> elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment 's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again and tried to conceal , by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . </s>\", '<s> mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , mr. collins began . </s>', '<s> \" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . </s>', \"<s> you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ;

secondly , that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness . </s>', '<s> twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) </s>', \"<s> on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh 's footstool , that she said , ' mr. collins , you must marry . </s>\", '<s> a clergyman like you must marry . </s>', '<s> choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake ; and for your _ own _ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . </s>', '<s> this is my advice . </s>', \"<s> find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her . ' </s>\", '<s> allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . </s>', '<s> you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , i think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . </s>', '<s> thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i can assure you there are many amiable young women . </s>', '<s> but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years . </s>', '<s> this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . </s>', '<s> and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . </s>', \"<s> to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ;

\" and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . \" </s>', '<s> to such perseverance in wilful self - deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive , and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . </s>', '<s> mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection . </s>', '<s> mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . </s>', '<s> this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so . </s>', '<s> \" but , depend upon it , mr. collins , \" she added , \" that lizzy shall be brought to reason . </s>', '<s> i will speak to her about it directly . </s>', '<s> she is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest but i will _ make _ </s>', '<s> her know it . \" </s>', '<s> \" pardon me for interrupting you , madam , \" cried mr. collins ;

and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation . </s>', '<s> she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins , when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . </s>', '<s> a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . </s>', '<s> as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them . </s>', '<s> \" my dear madam , \" he replied , \" this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . \" </s>', '<s> they were all astonished ; and mr. bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said : </s>', '<s> \" but is there not danger of lady catherine \\'s disapprobation here , my good sir ? </s>', '<s> you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . \" </s>', '<s> \" my dear sir , \" replied mr. collins , \" i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship \\'s concurrence . \" </s>', '<s> \" you can not be too much upon your guard . </s>', '<s> risk anything rather than her displeasure ;

though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied : </s>', '<s> \" why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? </s>', '<s> do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman \\'s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? \" </s>', '<s> but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . </s>', '<s> \" i see what you are feeling , \" replied charlotte . </s>', '<s> \" you must be surprised , very much surprised -- so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you . </s>', '<s> but when you have had time to think it over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done . </s>', '<s> i am not romantic , you know ; i never was . </s>', '<s> i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collins \\'s character , connection , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth quietly answered \" undoubtedly ; \" and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . </s>', '<s> charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . </s>', '<s> it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . </s>', \"<s> the strangeness of mr. collins 's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . </s>\", \"<s> she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she had not supposed it to be possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage . </s>\", '<s> charlotte the wife of mr. collins was a most humiliating picture ! </s>', '<s> and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter , to announce her engagement to the family . </s>', '<s> with many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter -- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed : </s>', '<s> \" good lord ! </s>', '<s> sir william , how can you tell such a story ? </s>', '<s> do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? \" </s>', \"<s> nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy . </s>\", '<s> elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london . </s>', '<s> mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . </s>', '<s> in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off . </s>', '<s> two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief ; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . </s>', '<s> nothing could console and nothing could appease her . </s>', '<s> nor did that day wear out her resentment . </s>', '<s> a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . </s>', \"<s> mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! </s>\", '<s> jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . </s>', '<s> kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton . </s>', \"<s> lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . </s>\", '<s> between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again . </s>', '<s> her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return . </s>', '<s> jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . </s>', \"<s> the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth 's abode in the family might have prompted . </s>\", '<s> after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . </s>', \"<s> mr. collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet . </s>\", '<s> on the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . </s>', '<s> it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome . </s>', '<s> she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . </s>', \"<s> such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley 's continued absence . </s>\", '<s> neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . </s>', '<s> day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . </s>', '<s> even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . </s>', \"<s> unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane 's happiness , and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently occurring . </s>\", '<s> the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . </s>', \"<s> as for jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than elizabeth 's , but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . </s>\", '<s> but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used . </s>', \"<s> it needed all jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . </s>\", '<s> mr. collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . </s>', '<s> he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . </s>', '<s> the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . </s>', '<s> mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state . </s>', '<s> the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill - humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . </s>', '<s> the sight of miss lucas was odious to her . </s>', '<s> as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . </s>', '<s> whenever charlotte came to see them , she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead . </s>', '<s> she complained bitterly of all this to her husband . </s>', '<s> \" indeed , mr. bennet , \" said she , \" it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take her place in it ! \" </s>', '<s> \" my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . </s>', '<s> let us hope for better things . </s>', '<s> let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor . \" </s>', '<s> this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet , and therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before . </s>', '<s> \" i can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . </s>', '<s> if it was not for the entail , i should not mind it . \" </s>', '<s> \" what should not you mind ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i should not mind anything at all . \" </s>', '<s> \" let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . \" </s>', '<s> \" i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for anything about the entail . </s>', \"<s> how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters , i can not understand ;

and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . </s>', '<s> her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . </s>', '<s> sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good - humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . </s>', \"<s> elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william 's too long . </s>\", '<s> he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ;

but in general charlotte wisely did not hear . </s>', '<s> after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey , and of all that had happened in london , mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . </s>', '<s> to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . </s>', '<s> here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind . </s>', '<s> he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . </s>', '<s> but of all the views which his garden , or which the country or kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . </s>', '<s> it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . </s>', \"<s> from his garden , mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows ;

and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit . </s>', \"<s> when mr. collins could be forgotten , there was really an air of great comfort throughout , and by charlotte 's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . </s>\", '<s> she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country . </s>', '<s> it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr. collins joining in , observed : </s>', '<s> \" yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her . </s>', '<s> she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . </s>', '<s> i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . </s>', '<s> her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming . </s>', '<s> we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . </s>', \"<s> her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . </s>\", '<s> i _ should _ say , one of her ladyship \\'s carriages , for she has several . \" </s>', '<s> \" lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , \" added charlotte , \" and a most attentive neighbour . \" </s>', '<s> \" very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say . </s>', '<s> she is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . \" </s>', \"<s> the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had already been written ;

and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh . </s>', \"<s> when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria 's alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm . </s>\", \"<s> elizabeth 's courage did not fail her . </s>\", '<s> she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation . </s>', '<s> from the entrance - hall , of which mr. collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and the finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an ante - chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs. jenkinson were sitting . </s>', '<s> her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . </s>', \"<s> in spite of having been at st. james 's sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . </s>\", '<s> elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . </s>', '<s> lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . </s>', '<s> her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . </s>', \"<s> she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeth 's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented . </s>\", \"<s> when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria 's astonishment at her being so thin and so small . </s>\", '<s> there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies . </s>', '<s> miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs. jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . </s>', '<s> after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . </s>', \"<s> the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised ;

but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing , and looking out of the window in his own book - room , which fronted the road . </s>', '<s> the room in which the ladies sat was backwards . </s>', '<s> elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a more pleasant aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement . </s>', '<s> from the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . </s>', \"<s> she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out . </s>\", '<s> very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ;

found fault with the arrangement of the furniture ; or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family . </s>\", '<s> elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . </s>', '<s> the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card - table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . </s>', \"<s> their other engagements were few , as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr. collins 's reach . </s>\", '<s> this , however , was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;

and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . </s>', '<s> he took the hint , and soon began with , \" this seems a very comfortable house . </s>', '<s> lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . \" </s>', '<s> \" i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . \" </s>', '<s> \" mr. collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , indeed , his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . </s>', '<s> my friend has an excellent understanding -- though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did . </s>', '<s> she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her . \" </s>', '<s> \" it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . \" </s>', '<s> \" an easy distance , do you call it ? </s>', '<s> it is nearly fifty miles . \" </s>', '<s> \" and what is fifty miles of good road ? </s>', \"<s> little more than half a day 's journey . </s>\", '<s> yes , i call it a _ very _ easy distance . \" </s>', '<s> \" i should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , \" cried elizabeth . </s>', '<s> \" i should never have said mrs. collins was settled _ near _ her family . \" </s>', '<s> \" it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . </s>', '<s> anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . \" </s>', '<s> as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered : </s>', '<s> \" i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . </s>', '<s> the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . </s>', '<s> where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . </s>', '<s> but that is not the case _ here _ . </s>', '<s> mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ </s>', '<s> her family under less than _ half _ the present distance . \" </s>', '<s> mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , \" _ you _ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . </s>', '<s> _ </s>', '<s> you _ can not have been always at longbourn . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth looked surprised . </s>', '<s> the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and glancing over it , said , in a colder voice : </s>', '<s> \" are you pleased with kent ? \" </s>', '<s> a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from her walk . </s>', '<s> the tete - a - tete surprised them . </s>', '<s> mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody , went away . </s>', '<s> \" what can be the meaning of this ? \" said charlotte , as soon as he was gone . </s>', '<s> \" my dear , eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called us in this familiar way . \" </s>', \"<s> but when elizabeth told of his silence ; it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . </s>\", '<s> all field sports were over . </s>', '<s> within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard - table , but gentlemen can not always be within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . </s>', '<s> they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . </s>', \"<s> it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . </s>\", '<s> but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . </s>', '<s> it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . </s>', '<s> he seldom appeared really animated . </s>', '<s> mrs. collins knew not what to make of him . </s>', \"<s> colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out . </s>\", '<s> she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success . </s>', '<s> he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable . </s>', '<s> it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . </s>', \"<s> she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . </s>\", '<s> in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam . </s>', '<s> he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . </s>', '<s> more than once did elizabeth , in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy . </s>', '<s> she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought , and , to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers . </s>', '<s> how it could occur a second time , therefore , was very odd ! </s>', '<s> yet it did , and even a third . </s>', '<s> it seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . </s>', \"<s> he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _ there _ too . </s>\", '<s> his words seemed to imply it . </s>', '<s> could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? </s>', '<s> she supposed , if he meant anything , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . </s>', '<s> it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage . </s>', \"<s> she was engaged one day as she walked , in perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . </s>\", '<s> putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said : </s>', '<s> \" i did not know before that you ever walked this way . \" </s>', '<s> \" i have been making the tour of the park , \" he replied , \" as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage . </s>', '<s> are you going much farther ? \" </s>', '<s> \" no , i should have turned in a moment . \" </s>', '<s> and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together . </s>', '<s> \" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? \" said she . </s>', '<s> \" yes -- if darcy does not put it off again . </s>', '<s> but i am at his disposal . </s>', '<s> he arranges the business just as he pleases . \" </s>', '<s> \" and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice . </s>', '<s> i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy . \" </s>', '<s> \" he likes to have his own way very well , \" replied colonel fitzwilliam . </s>', '<s> \" but so we all do . </s>', '<s> it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . </s>', '<s> i speak feelingly . </s>', '<s> a younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . \" </s>', '<s> \" in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . </s>', '<s> now seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? </s>', '<s> when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? \" </s>', '<s> \" these are home questions -- and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature . </s>', '<s> but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from want of money . </s>', '<s> younger sons can not marry where they like . \" </s>', '<s> \" unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . \" </s>', '<s> \" our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . \" </s>', '<s> \" is this , \" thought elizabeth , \" meant for me ? \" </s>', '<s> and she coloured at the idea ;

but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister . </s>\", '<s> the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening , that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . </s>', \"<s> mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home . </s>\", '<s> when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent . </s>', '<s> they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . </s>', '<s> but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone , had been scarcely ever clouded . </s>', '<s> elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . </s>', \"<s> mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings . </s>\", '<s> it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next -- and , a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . </s>', \"<s> she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . </s>\", '<s> while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door - bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to inquire particularly after her . </s>', '<s> but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room . </s>', '<s> in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . </s>', '<s> she answered him with cold civility . </s>', '<s> he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up , walked about the room . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . </s>', '<s> after a silence of several minutes , he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began : </s>', '<s> \" in vain i have struggled . </s>', '<s> it will not do . </s>', '<s> my feelings will not be repressed . </s>', '<s> you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . \" </s>', \"<s> elizabeth 's astonishment was beyond expression . </s>\", '<s> she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . </s>', '<s> this he considered sufficient encouragement ;

and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . \" </s>', '<s> \" you have said quite enough , madam . </s>', '<s> i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . </s>', '<s> forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . \" </s>', '<s> and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . </s>', '<s> the tumult of her mind , was now painfully great . </s>', '<s> she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half - an - hour . </s>', '<s> her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . </s>', '<s> that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy ! </s>', '<s> that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! </s>', \"<s> so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case -- was almost incredible ! </s>\", '<s> it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . </s>', '<s> but his pride , his abominable pride -- his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane -- his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . </s>', \"<s> she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room . </s>\", '<s> elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes . </s>', '<s> she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of anything else ; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved , soon after breakfast , to indulge herself in air and exercise . </s>', \"<s> she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led farther from the turnpike - road . </s>\", '<s> the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . </s>', '<s> after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . </s>', '<s> the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees . </s>', '<s> she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and , fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating . </s>', '<s> but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . </s>', '<s> she had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate . </s>', '<s> he had by that time reached it also , and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said , with a look of haughty composure , \" i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . </s>', '<s> will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? \" </s>', '<s> and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight . </s>', '<s> with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and , to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter - paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . </s>', '<s> the envelope itself was likewise full . </s>', '<s> pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it . </s>', \"<s> it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows:-- </s>\", '<s> \" be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you . </s>', '<s> i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . </s>', '<s> you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice . </s>', '<s> \" two offenses of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . </s>', '<s> the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham . </s>', '<s> wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . </s>', '<s> but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in the future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . </s>', '<s> if , in the explanation of them , which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , i can only say that i am sorry . </s>', '<s> the necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd . </s>', '<s> \" i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . </s>', '<s> but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . </s>', '<s> i had often seen him in love before . </s>', \"<s> at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas 's accidental information , that bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . </s>\", '<s> he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . </s>', \"<s> from that moment i observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him . </s>\", '<s> your sister i also watched . </s>', \"<s> her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . </s>\", '<s> if _ you _ have not been mistaken here , _ i _ must have been in error . </s>', '<s> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . </s>', '<s> if it be so , if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . </s>', \"<s> but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . </s>\", '<s> that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain -- but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . </s>', '<s> i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason . </s>', '<s> my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . </s>', '<s> but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . </s>', '<s> these causes must be stated , though briefly . </s>', \"<s> the situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . </s>\", '<s> pardon me . </s>', '<s> it pains me to offend you . </s>', '<s> but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . </s>', '<s> i will only say farther that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection . </s>', '<s> he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . </s>', '<s> \" the part which i acted is now to be explained . </s>', \"<s> his sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered , and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london . </s>\", '<s> we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . </s>', '<s> i described , and enforced them earnestly . </s>', \"<s> but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference . </s>\", '<s> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . </s>', '<s> but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own . </s>', '<s> to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . </s>', '<s> to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . </s>', '<s> i can not blame myself for having done thus much . </s>', \"<s> there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town . </s>\", '<s> i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . </s>', '<s> that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable ;

but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . </s>', '<s> \" mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on george wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . </s>', \"<s> my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge -- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education . </s>\", \"<s> my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manner were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . </s>\", '<s> as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . </s>', '<s> the vicious propensities -- the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have . </s>', '<s> here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . </s>', '<s> but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character -- it adds even another motive . </s>', '<s> \" my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow -- and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . </s>', '<s> there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . </s>', '<s> his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . </s>', '<s> he had some intention , he added , of studying law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . </s>', '<s> i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . </s>', '<s> i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman ; the business was therefore soon settled -- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . </s>', '<s> all connection between us seemed now dissolved . </s>', '<s> i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town . </s>', '<s> in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . </s>', '<s> for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . </s>', '<s> his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . </s>', \"<s> he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions . </s>\", '<s> you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition to it . </s>', '<s> his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . </s>', '<s> after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . </s>', '<s> how he lived i know not . </s>', '<s> but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . </s>', '<s> \" i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . </s>', '<s> having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy . </s>', \"<s> my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself . </s>\", '<s> about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . </s>', '<s> she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself . </s>', '<s> i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . </s>', '<s> you may imagine what i felt and how i acted . </s>', \"<s> regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge . </s>\", \"<s> mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;

and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits ; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _ some _ amiable feeling ; that had his actions been what mr. wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible . </s>', '<s> she grew absolutely ashamed of herself . </s>', '<s> of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . </s>', '<s> \" how despicably i have acted ! \" </s>', '<s> she cried ;

and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin . </s>', '<s> they were hopeless of remedy . </s>', '<s> her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . </s>', \"<s> elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ;

and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . </s>', \"<s> she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . </s>\", '<s> he heard her attentively , and then said : </s>', '<s> \" lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . \" </s>', '<s> \" if you were aware , \" said elizabeth , \" of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia \\'s unguarded and imprudent manner -- nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . \" </s>', '<s> \" already arisen ? \" repeated mr. bennet . </s>', '<s> \" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? </s>', '<s> poor little lizzy ! </s>', '<s> but do not be cast down . </s>', '<s> such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . </s>', '<s> come , let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia \\'s folly . \" </s>', '<s> \" indeed you are mistaken . </s>', '<s> i have no such injuries to resent . </s>', '<s> it is not of particular , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . </s>', \"<s> our importance , our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia 's character . </s>\", '<s> excuse me , for i must speak plainly . </s>', '<s> if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . </s>', '<s> her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous ; a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . </s>', '<s> in this danger kitty also is comprehended . </s>', '<s> she will follow wherever lydia leads . </s>', '<s> vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! </s>', '<s> oh ! </s>', '<s> my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? \" </s>', '<s> mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject , and affectionately taking her hand said in reply : </s>', '<s> \" do not make yourself uneasy , my love . </s>', '<s> wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued ;

and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . </s>', '<s> had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? </s>', '<s> they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . </s>', \"<s> lydia 's going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband 's never intending to go there himself . </s>\", \"<s> but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ;

the agitations of formal partiality entirely so . </s>', '<s> she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . </s>', '<s> in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . </s>', '<s> she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ;

for a few minutes he was silent , till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents : </s>\", '<s> \" you , who so well know my feeling towards mr. darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . </s>', '<s> his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . </s>', '<s> i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe . </s>', '<s> his fear of her has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . </s>', '<s> she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . </s>', '<s> the rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . </s>', '<s> when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . </s>', '<s> the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . </s>', '<s> kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . </s>', '<s> mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible -- advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . </s>', \"<s> had elizabeth 's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . </s>\", '<s> her father , captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . </s>', '<s> respect , esteem , and confidence had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . </s>', '<s> but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . </s>', '<s> he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . </s>', '<s> to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . </s>', '<s> this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given . </s>', \"<s> elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father 's behaviour as a husband . </s>\", '<s> she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . </s>', '<s> but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents , which , rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife . </s>', \"<s> when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham 's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . </s>\", '<s> their parties abroad were less varied than before , and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering - place and a camp . </s>', '<s> upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . </s>', '<s> it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity -- to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . </s>', '<s> her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . </s>', '<s> \" but it is fortunate , \" thought she , \" that i have something to wish for . </s>', '<s> were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . </s>', \"<s> but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised . </s>\", '<s> a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . \" </s>', '<s> when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . </s>', '<s> those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going off to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . </s>', '<s> after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour , and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn . </s>', '<s> everything wore a happier aspect . </s>', '<s> the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . </s>', '<s> mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and , by the middle of june , kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton . </s>', '<s> the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching , and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent . </s>', '<s> mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month , and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour , and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire . </s>', '<s> in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . </s>', '<s> the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes , and still thought there might have been time enough . </s>', '<s> but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . </s>', '<s> with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected . </s>', '<s> it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner . </s>', '<s> \" but surely , \" said she , \" i may enter his county without impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . \" </s>', '<s> the period of expectation was now doubled . </s>', \"<s> four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt 's arrival . </s>\", '<s> but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . </s>', '<s> the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . </s>', '<s> the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . </s>', '<s> one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness of companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad . </s>', '<s> it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenilworth , birmingham , etc . are sufficiently known . </s>', '<s> a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern . </s>', \"<s> to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs. gardiner 's former residence , and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated . </s>\", '<s> it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . </s>', '<s> in talking over their route the evening before , mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . </s>', '<s> mr. gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . </s>', '<s> \" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? \" said her aunt ; \" a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintances are connected . </s>', '<s> wickham passed all his youth there , you know . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth was distressed . </s>', '<s> she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . </s>', '<s> she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . </s>', '<s> mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity . </s>', '<s> \" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , \" said she , \" i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . </s>', '<s> they have some of the finest woods in the country . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce . </s>', '<s> the possibility of meeting mr. darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . </s>', '<s> it would be dreadful ! </s>', '<s> she blushed at the very idea , and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk . </s>', '<s> but against this there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered . </s>', '<s> accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place ? </s>', '<s> what was the name of its proprietor ? </s>', '<s> and , with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer ? </s>', '<s> a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms now being removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . </s>', '<s> to pemberley , therefore , they were to go . </s>', '<s> elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . </s>', '<s> the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . </s>', '<s> they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent . </s>', \"<s> elizabeth 's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . </s>\", '<s> they gradually ascended for half - a - mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . </s>', '<s> it was a large , handsome stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . </s>', '<s> its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was delighted . </s>', '<s> she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . </s>', '<s> they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! </s>', '<s> they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned . </s>', '<s> she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . </s>', '<s> on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . </s>', '<s> the housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . </s>', '<s> they followed her into the dining - parlour . </s>', '<s> it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up . </s>', '<s> elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . </s>', '<s> the hill , crowned with wood , which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . </s>', '<s> every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . </s>', '<s> as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . </s>', '<s> the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings . </s>', '<s> \" and of this place , \" thought she , \" i might have been mistress ! </s>', '<s> with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! </s>', '<s> instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . </s>', '<s> but no,\"--recollecting herself--\"that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; i should not have been allowed to invite them . \" </s>', '<s> this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something very like regret . </s>', '<s> she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent , but had not the courage for it . </s>', '<s> at length however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs. reynolds replied that he was , adding , \" but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . \" </s>', '<s> how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! </s>', '<s> her aunt now called her to look at a picture . </s>', '<s> she approached and saw the likeness of mr. wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantelpiece . </s>', '<s> her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . </s>', \"<s> the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master 's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense . </s>\", '<s> \" he is now gone into the army , \" she added ; \" but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . \" </s>', '<s> mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it . </s>', '<s> \" and that , \" said mrs. reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , \" is my master -- and very like him . </s>', '<s> it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . \" </s>', '<s> \" i have heard much of your master \\'s fine person , \" said mrs. gardiner , looking at the picture ; \" it is a handsome face . </s>', '<s> but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . \" </s>', '<s> mrs. reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master . </s>', '<s> \" does that young lady know mr. darcy ? \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth coloured , and said : \" a little . \" </s>', '<s> \" and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma\\'am ? \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , very handsome . \" </s>', '<s> \" i am sure i know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . </s>', \"<s> this room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . </s>\", '<s> he was very fond of them . \" </s>', \"<s> this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham 's being among them . </s>\", '<s> mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . </s>', '<s> \" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? \" said mrs. gardiner . </s>', '<s> \" oh ! yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long . </s>', '<s> in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him . \" </s>', '<s> mr. gardiner , whose manners were very easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs. reynolds , either by pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . </s>', '<s> \" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? \" </s>', '<s> \" not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months . \" </s>', '<s> \" except , \" thought elizabeth , \" when she goes to ramsgate . \" </s>', '<s> \" if your master would marry , you might see more of him . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , sir ; but i do not know when _ that _ will be . </s>', '<s> i do not know who is good enough for him . \" </s>', '<s> mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled . </s>', '<s> elizabeth could not help saying , \" it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . \" </s>', '<s> \" i say no more than the truth , and everybody will say that knows him , \" replied the other . </s>', '<s> elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , \" i have never known a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old . \" </s>', '<s> this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . </s>', '<s> that he was not a good - tempered man had been her firmest opinion . </s>', '<s> her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying : </s>', '<s> \" there are very few people of whom so much can be said . </s>', '<s> you are lucky in having such a master . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , sir , i know i am . </s>', '<s> if i were to go through the world , i could not meet with a better . </s>', '<s> but i have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth almost stared at her . </s>', '<s> \" can this be mr. darcy ? \" thought she . </s>', '<s> \" his father was an excellent man , \" said mrs. gardiner . </s>', '<s> \" yes , ma\\'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . </s>', '<s> mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point . </s>', '<s> she related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . </s>', '<s> mr. gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase . </s>', '<s> \" he is the best landlord , and the best master , \" said she , \" that ever lived ; not like the wild young men nowadays , who think of nothing but themselves . </s>', '<s> there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name . </s>', '<s> some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw anything of it . </s>', '<s> to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . \" </s>', '<s> \" in what an amiable light does this place him ! \" thought elizabeth . </s>', '<s> \" this fine account of him , \" whispered her aunt as they walked , \" is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps we might be deceived . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is not very likely ; our authority was too good . \" </s>', '<s> on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley . </s>', '<s> \" he is certainly a good brother , \" said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . </s>', \"<s> mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy 's delight , when she should enter the room . </s>\", '<s> \" and this is always the way with him , \" she added . </s>', '<s> \" whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment . </s>', '<s> there is nothing he would not do for her . \" </s>', '<s> the picture - gallery , and two or three of the principal bedrooms , were all that remained to be shown . </s>', \"<s> in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . </s>\", '<s> in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . </s>', '<s> elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . </s>', '<s> at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her . </s>', '<s> she stood several minutes before the picture , in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . </s>', \"<s> mrs. reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father 's lifetime . </s>\", \"<s> there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth 's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance . </s>\", '<s> the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature . </s>', '<s> what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? </s>', \"<s> as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people 's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him ! </s>\", '<s> every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . </s>', '<s> when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned downstairs , and , taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall - door . </s>', '<s> as they walked across the hall towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . </s>', '<s> they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . </s>', '<s> their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush . </s>', '<s> he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . </s>', '<s> she had instinctively turned away ; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . </s>', \"<s> had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener 's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . </s>\", '<s> they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family . </s>', '<s> amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life . </s>', '<s> nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her having stayed in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . </s>', '<s> at length every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . </s>', '<s> the others then joined her , and expressed admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . </s>', '<s> she was overpowered by shame and vexation . </s>', '<s> her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world ! </s>', '<s> how strange it must appear to him ! </s>', '<s> in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! </s>', '<s> it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! </s>', '<s> oh ! why did she come ? </s>', '<s> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? </s>', '<s> had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination ; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived -- that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . </s>', '<s> she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . </s>', '<s> and his behaviour , so strikingly altered -- what could it mean ? </s>', '<s> that he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility , to inquire after her family ! </s>', '<s> never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . </s>', '<s> what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park , when he put his letter into her hand ! </s>', '<s> she knew not what to think , or how to account for it . </s>', '<s> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . </s>', '<s> her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was . </s>', '<s> she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind -- in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . </s>', '<s> perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _ that _ in his voice which was not like ease . </s>', '<s> whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . </s>', '<s> at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . </s>', '<s> they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; when , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . </s>', '<s> mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . </s>', '<s> with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round . </s>', '<s> it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , and one of its narrowest parts . </s>', '<s> they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it . </s>', '<s> elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . </s>', '<s> her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . </s>', \"<s> whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . </s>\", '<s> the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . </s>', '<s> elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . </s>', '<s> for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . </s>', '<s> the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . </s>', '<s> with a glance , she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words \" delightful , \" and \" charming , \" when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed . </s>', '<s> her colour changed , and she said no more . </s>', '<s> mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . </s>', '<s> this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself . </s>', '<s> \" what will be his surprise , \" thought she , \" when he knows who they are ? </s>', '<s> he takes them now for people of fashion . \" </s>', '<s> the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it , and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . </s>', '<s> that he was _ surprised _ by the connection was evident ; he sustained it , however , with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned his back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner . </s>', '<s> elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . </s>', '<s> it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . </s>', '<s> she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . </s>', '<s> the conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . </s>', '<s> mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm - in - arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of wonder . </s>', '<s> elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . </s>', '<s> her astonishment , however , was extreme , and continually was she repeating , \" why is he so altered ? </s>', '<s> from what can it proceed ? </s>', '<s> it can not be for _ me_--it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . </s>', '<s> my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . </s>', '<s> it is impossible that he should still love me . \" </s>', '<s> after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . </s>', \"<s> it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's . </s>\", '<s> mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . </s>', '<s> after a short silence , the lady first spoke . </s>', '<s> she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected--\"for your housekeeper , \" she added , \" informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . \" </s>', '<s> he acknowledged the truth of it all , and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . </s>', '<s> \" they will join me early to - morrow , \" he continued , \" and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you -- mr. bingley and his sisters . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . </s>', \"<s> her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been the last mentioned between them ; and , if she might judge by his complexion , _ his _ mind was not very differently engaged . </s>\", '<s> \" there is also one other person in the party , \" he continued after a pause , \" who more particularly wishes to be known to you . </s>', '<s> will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? \" </s>', '<s> the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . </s>', '<s> she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother , and , without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . </s>', '<s> they now walked on in silence , each of them deep in thought . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . </s>', '<s> his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind . </s>', '<s> they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . </s>', '<s> he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . </s>', '<s> at such a time much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . </s>', '<s> she wanted to talk , but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject . </s>', '<s> at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance . </s>', '<s> yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the tete - a - tete was over . </s>', \"<s> on mr. and mrs. gardiner 's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ;

and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected . </s>', '<s> \" he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , \" said her uncle . </s>', '<s> \" there _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , \" replied her aunt , \" but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . </s>', '<s> i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it . \" </s>', '<s> \" i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . </s>', '<s> it was more than civil ;

or , rather , he has not wickham \\'s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . </s>', '<s> but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable ? \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . </s>', '<s> \" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , \" replied her uncle . </s>', '<s> \" your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character , but said nothing . </s>', '<s> \" from what we have seen of him , \" continued mrs. gardiner , \" i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham . </s>', '<s> he has not an ill - natured look . </s>', '<s> on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . </s>', '<s> and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . </s>', '<s> but , to be sure , the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character ! </s>', '<s> i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . </s>', '<s> but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _ that _ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . \" </s>', \"<s> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham 's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . </s>\", '<s> in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . </s>', '<s> mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else . </s>', \"<s> fatigued as she had been by the morning 's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years ' discontinuance . </s>\", \"<s> the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy 's civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . </s>\", '<s> elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . </s>', '<s> but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton , these visitors came . </s>', '<s> they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street . </s>', '<s> elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . </s>', '<s> her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . </s>', '<s> nothing had ever suggested it before , but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece . </s>', \"<s> while these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth 's feelings was at every moment increasing . </s>\", '<s> she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . </s>', '<s> she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse . </s>', '<s> miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . </s>', '<s> with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . </s>', '<s> since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . </s>', '<s> she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . </s>', '<s> miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . </s>', '<s> she was less handsome than her brother ; but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . </s>', '<s> elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings . </s>', \"<s> they had not long been together before mr. darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley 's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . </s>\", \"<s> all elizabeth 's anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . </s>\", '<s> he inquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done . </s>', '<s> to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . </s>', '<s> they had long wished to see him . </s>', '<s> the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . </s>', '<s> the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry ; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . </s>', \"<s> of the lady 's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . </s>\", '<s> elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . </s>', '<s> she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors ; she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour . </s>', '<s> bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . </s>', '<s> in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and , oh ! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . </s>', '<s> sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . </s>', '<s> but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival to jane . </s>', '<s> no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . </s>', '<s> nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . </s>', '<s> on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . </s>', '<s> he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it \" was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; \" and , before she could reply , he added , \" it is above eight months . </s>', '<s> we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . \" </s>', '<s> elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _ all _ her sisters were at longbourn . </s>', '<s> there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark ; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . </s>', '<s> it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from _ hauteur _ or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . </s>', '<s> when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace -- when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage -- the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . </s>', '<s> never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings . </s>', '<s> their visitors stayed with them above half - an - hour ; and when they arose to depart , mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country . </s>', '<s> miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . </s>', '<s> mrs. gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _ she _ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . </s>', '<s> presuming however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . </s>', '<s> bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . </s>', '<s> elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased , and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half - hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . </s>', '<s> eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . </s>', \"<s> but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner 's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . </s>\", '<s> it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . </s>', '<s> they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify inquiry . </s>', '<s> of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . </s>', \"<s> they could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant 's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr. darcy . </s>\", '<s> there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . </s>', '<s> neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight . </s>', '<s> they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town where the family did not visit . </s>', '<s> it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . </s>', '<s> with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well - known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged . </s>', '<s> as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _ one _ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out . </s>', '<s> she certainly did not hate him . </s>', '<s> no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . </s>', '<s> the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . </s>', '<s> but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked . </s>', '<s> it was gratitude ; gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . </s>', '<s> he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . </s>', '<s> such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . </s>', '<s> she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses . </s>', \"<s> it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . </s>\", '<s> they were , therefore , to go . </s>', '<s> elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . </s>', '<s> mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast . </s>', '<s> the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon . </s>', \"<s> convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady 's side the acquaintance would now be renewed . </s>\", '<s> on reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . </s>', '<s> its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . </s>', '<s> in this house they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london . </s>', \"<s> georgiana 's reception of them was very civil , but attended with all the embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . </s>\", '<s> mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . </s>', '<s> by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and , on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . </s>', '<s> it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well - bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . </s>', '<s> miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard . </s>', '<s> elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention . </s>', '<s> this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . </s>', '<s> her own thoughts were employing her . </s>', '<s> she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . </s>', '<s> she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . </s>', \"<s> after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley 's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family . </s>\", '<s> she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the others said no more . </s>', '<s> the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . </s>', '<s> there was now employment for the whole party -- for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches soon collected them round the table . </s>', '<s> while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . </s>', '<s> he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . </s>', '<s> no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . </s>', \"<s> in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over . </s>\", \"<s> miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk , and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . </s>\", '<s> miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility : </s>', '<s> \" pray , miss eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton ? </s>', '<s> they must be a great loss to _ your _ family . \" </s>', \"<s> in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone . </s>\", '<s> while she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her darcy , with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . </s>', \"<s> had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . </s>\", \"<s> not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement . </s>\", \"<s> to no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to elizabeth ;

and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . </s>\", '<s> her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully . </s>', \"<s> their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress . </s>\", '<s> but georgiana would not join her . </s>', \"<s> her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour ; his judgement could not err . </s>\", '<s> and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . </s>', '<s> when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . </s>', '<s> \" how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , \" she cried ; \" i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . </s>', '<s> she is grown so brown and coarse ! </s>', '<s> louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . \" </s>', '<s> however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . </s>', '<s> \" for my own part , \" she rejoined , \" i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her . </s>', '<s> her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . </s>', '<s> her nose wants character -- there is nothing marked in its lines . </s>', '<s> her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i could never see anything extraordinary in them . </s>', '<s> they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . \" </s>', '<s> persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . </s>', '<s> he was resolutely silent , however , and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued : </s>', '<s> \" i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ;

' </s>\", '<s> but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , \" replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , \" but _ that _ was only when i first saw her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . \" </s>', '<s> he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . </s>', '<s> mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . </s>', '<s> the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . </s>', \"<s> they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit -- of everything but himself ;

and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , \" i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but </s>', '<s> real , though unavailing concern . </s>', '<s> would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress ! </s>', '<s> but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . </s>', '<s> this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister \\'s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to - day . \" </s>', '<s> \" oh , yes . </s>', '<s> be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy . </s>', '<s> say that urgent business calls us home immediately . </s>', '<s> conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible , i know it can not be long . \" </s>', '<s> he readily assured her of his secrecy ; again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting look , went away . </s>', '<s> as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . </s>', \"<s> if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth 's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . </s>\", '<s> but if otherwise -- if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . </s>', \"<s> be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . </s>\", \"<s> never , since reading jane 's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham 's meaning to marry her . </s>\", '<s> no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . </s>', '<s> surprise was the least of her feelings on this development . </s>', '<s> while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;

and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room her impatience was severe . </s>\", \"<s> mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing by the servant 's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;

and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn . </s>', '<s> \" i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , \" said her uncle , as they drove from the town ;

for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . </s>', '<s> but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good . </s>', '<s> lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father \\'s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . \" </s>', '<s> \" but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage ? \" </s>', '<s> \" it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , \" replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , \" that a sister \\'s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . </s>', '<s> but , really , i know not what to say . </s>', '<s> perhaps i am not doing her justice . </s>', '<s> but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half - year , nay , for a twelvemonth -- she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . </s>', '<s> she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . </s>', '<s> since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head . </s>', '<s> she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall i call it ? </s>', '<s> susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . </s>', '<s> and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . \" </s>', '<s> \" but you see that jane , \" said her aunt , \" does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt . \" </s>', '<s> \" of whom does jane ever think ill ? </s>', '<s> and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would think capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? </s>', '<s> but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is . </s>', '<s> we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . \" </s>', '<s> \" and do you really know all this ? \" cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . </s>', '<s> \" i do indeed , \" replied elizabeth , colouring . </s>', '<s> \" i told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ;

which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . </s>', '<s> it was as follows : </s>', '<s> \" my dear sir , </s>', '<s> \" i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire . </s>', '<s> be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . </s>', \"<s> no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune -- or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent 's mind . </s>\", '<s> the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . </s>', '<s> and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . </s>', '<s> howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . </s>', '<s> they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? </s>', '<s> and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last november ; for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . </s>', '<s> let me then advise you , dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense . </s>', '<s> \" i am , dear sir , etc . , etc . \" </s>', '<s> mr. gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster ;

so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been . </s>', '<s> he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both ; wickham repeatedly , lydia once . </s>', '<s> from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . </s>', \"<s> the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . </s>\", '<s> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . </s>', '<s> his character was to speak for itself . </s>', '<s> he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . </s>', '<s> if he _ had another _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . </s>', '<s> he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . </s>', '<s> \" there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . </s>', '<s> she then took a large house in edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . </s>', '<s> this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ;

she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving wickham . </s>', '<s> she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . </s>', '<s> since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design . </s>', \"<s> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of lydia 's flight on her own folly alone . </s>\", '<s> he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . </s>', '<s> he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . </s>', '<s> \" mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . </s>', '<s> though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . </s>', '<s> but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country . </s>', '<s> under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . </s>', '<s> \" they met several times , for there was much to be discussed . </s>', '<s> wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . </s>', '<s> \" every thing being settled between _ them _ , mr. darcy \\'s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home . </s>', '<s> but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . </s>', '<s> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . </s>', '<s> he did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . </s>', '<s> \" on saturday he came again . </s>', '<s> your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . </s>', '<s> \" they met again on sunday , and then _ i _ saw him too . </s>', '<s> it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . </s>', '<s> but our visitor was very obstinate . </s>', '<s> i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . </s>', '<s> he has been accused of many faults at different times , but _ this _ is the true one . </s>', '<s> nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ;

and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . </s>', '<s> but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most . </s>', '<s> \" you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . </s>', '<s> his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased . </s>', '<s> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . </s>', \"<s> it was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . </s>\", \"<s> perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ;

and it was certain that , in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side . </s>', '<s> with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . </s>', '<s> if he had been wavering before as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him . </s>', '<s> in that case he would return no more . </s>', '<s> lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way . </s>', '<s> \" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , \" she added , \" i shall know how to understand it . </s>', '<s> i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . </s>', '<s> if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . \" </s>', '<s> * * * </s>', '<s> * * </s>', \"<s> the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ;

but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : </s>\", '<s> \" i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write . </s>', '<s> you supposed more than really existed . </s>', '<s> but _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose rein to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . </s>', '<s> you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . </s>', '<s> i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes . </s>', '<s> how could i be so silly as to wish it ! </s>', '<s> your idea of the ponies is delightful . </s>', '<s> we will go round the park every day . </s>', '<s> i am the happiest creature in the world . </s>', '<s> perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . </s>', '<s> i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh . </s>', '<s> mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me . </s>', '<s> you are all to come to pemberley at christmas . </s>', '<s> yours , etc . \" </s>', \"<s> mr. darcy 's letter to lady catherine was in a different style ; and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last . </s>\", '<s> \" dear sir , </s>', '<s> \" i must trouble you once more for congratulations . </s>', '<s> elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy . </s>', '<s> console lady catherine as well as you can . </s>', '<s> but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . </s>', '<s> he has more to give . </s>', '<s> \" yours sincerely , etc . \" </s>', \"<s> miss bingley 's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . </s>\", '<s> she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . </s>', '<s> jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . </s>', \"<s> the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother 's in sending it . </s>\", '<s> four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . </s>', '<s> before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge . </s>', '<s> the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . </s>', \"<s> lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew 's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . </s>\", '<s> at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . </s>', '<s> he bore it , however , with admirable calmness . </s>', \"<s> he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st. james 's , with very decent composure . </s>\", '<s> if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight . </s>', \"<s> mrs. phillips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . </s>\", '<s> nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . </s>', '<s> elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley . </s>', '<s> happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . </s>', '<s> with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley , and talked of mrs. darcy , may be guessed . </s>', '<s> i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . </s>', '<s> mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do . </s>', '<s> he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected . </s>', '<s> mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth . </s>', '<s> so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart . </s>', '<s> the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . </s>', '<s> kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . </s>', '<s> in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . </s>', \"<s> she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia ; and , removed from the influence of lydia 's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . </s>\", \"<s> from the further disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . </s>\", \"<s> mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone . </s>\", \"<s> mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . </s>\", '<s> as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters . </s>', '<s> he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . </s>', '<s> the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . </s>', '<s> the letter was to this effect : </s>', '<s> \" my dear lizzy , </s>', '<s> \" i wish you joy . </s>', '<s> if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy . </s>', '<s> it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us . </s>', '<s> i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . </s>', '<s> any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not . </s>', '<s> \" yours , etc . \" </s>', '<s> as it happened that elizabeth had _ much _ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . </s>', '<s> such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . </s>', '<s> it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . </s>', '<s> their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . </s>', '<s> they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . </s>', '<s> his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; hers lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . </s>', \"<s> though darcy could never receive _ him _ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth 's sake , he assisted him further in his profession . </s>\", \"<s> lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . </s>\", \"<s> miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy 's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth . </s>\", \"<s> pemberley was now georgiana 's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . </s>\", '<s> they were able to love each other even as well as they intended . </s>', '<s> georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother . </s>', '<s> he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . </s>', '<s> her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . </s>', \"<s> by elizabeth 's instructions , she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . </s>\", '<s> lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . </s>', \"<s> but at length , by elizabeth 's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . </s>\", '<s> with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . </s>', '<s> darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . </s>']\n"

for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr. henry dashwood , the legal inheritor of the norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it . </s>', \"<s> in the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old gentleman 's days were comfortably spent . </s>\", '<s> his attachment to them all increased . </s>', '<s> the constant attention of mr. and mrs. henry dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence . </s>', '<s> by a former marriage , mr. henry dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters . </s>', '<s> the son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age . </s>', '<s> by his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth . </s>', \"<s> to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father 's inheriting that property , could be but small . </s>\", \"<s> their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife 's fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . </s>\", '<s> the old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . </s>', '<s> he was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ; but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . </s>', \"<s> mr. dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ; but to his son , and his son 's son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods . </s>\", '<s> the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters . </s>', '<s> he meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>', \"<s> mr. dashwood 's disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement . </s>\", '<s> but the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . </s>', '<s> he survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters . </s>', '<s> his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him mr. dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters . </s>', '<s> mr. john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable . </s>', '<s> his father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and mr. john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . </s>', \"<s> [ illustration : _ his son 's son , a child of four years old . _ ] </s>\", '<s> he was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . </s>', '<s> had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was : he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . </s>', '<s> but mrs. john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ; more narrow - minded and selfish . </s>', '<s> when he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>', '<s> he then really thought himself equal to it . </s>', \"<s> the prospect of four thousand a - year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother 's fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity . </s>\", '<s> yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! </s>', '<s> it would be enough to make them completely easy . </s>', '<s> three thousand pounds ! </s>', '<s> he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . </s>', '<s> he thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent . </s>', \"<s> no sooner was his father 's funeral over , than mrs. john dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants . </s>\", \"<s> no one could dispute her right to come ;

but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it . </s>\", '<s> so acutely did mrs. dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother . </s>', '<s> elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in mrs. dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . </s>', '<s> she had an excellent heart ; her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught . </s>', \"<s> marianne 's abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to elinor 's . </s>\", '<s> she was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . </s>', '<s> she was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent . </s>', '<s> the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great . </s>', \"<s> elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister 's sensibility ; but by mrs. dashwood it was valued and cherished . </s>\", '<s> they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction . </s>', '<s> the agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again . </s>', '<s> they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future . </s>', '<s> elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . </s>', '<s> she could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance . </s>', \"<s> margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ;

not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . </s>', '<s> but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : \" _ i can not imagine how they will spend half of it . _ \" ] </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . </s>', \"<s> she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would support her in affluence . </s>\", \"<s> for their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ;

and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . </s>', '<s> no sooner was her answer dispatched , than mrs. dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . </s>', '<s> they heard her with surprise . </s>', '<s> mrs. john dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland . </s>', '<s> she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire . </s>', '<s> edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , \" devonshire ! </s>', '<s> are you , indeed , going there ? </s>', '<s> so far from hence ! </s>', '<s> and to what part of it ? \" </s>', '<s> she explained the situation . </s>', '<s> it was within four miles northward of exeter . </s>', '<s> \" it is but a cottage , \" she continued , \" but i hope to see many of my friends in it . </s>', '<s> a room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , i am sure i will find none in accommodating them . \" </s>', '<s> she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr. and mrs. john dashwood to visit her at barton ; and to edward she gave one with still greater affection . </s>', '<s> though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . </s>', '<s> to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show mrs. john dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . </s>', '<s> mr. john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . </s>', '<s> he really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable . </s>', '<s> the furniture was all sent around by water . </s>', \"<s> it chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of marianne 's . </s>\", \"<s> mrs. john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs. dashwood 's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture . </s>\", '<s> mrs. dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . </s>', '<s> no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done . </s>', '<s> the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . </s>', '<s> for the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of elinor prevailed . </s>', '<s> _ her _ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland . </s>', \"<s> the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs. dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on sir john 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . </s>\", '<s> her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . </s>', \"<s> now was the time when her son - in - law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . </s>\", '<s> since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . </s>', '<s> but mrs. dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland . </s>', '<s> he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . </s>', \"<s> in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middleton 's first letter to norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs. dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . </s>\", '<s> many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . </s>', '<s> \" dear , dear norland ! \" said marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; \" when shall i cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere ! </s>', '<s> oh ! happy house , could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps i may view you no more ! </s>', '<s> and you , ye well - known trees!--but you will continue the same . </s>', '<s> no leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer ! </s>', '<s> no ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade ! </s>', '<s> but who will remain to enjoy you ? \" </s>', '<s> the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant . </s>', '<s> but as they drew towards the end of it , their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection , and a view of barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness . </s>', '<s> it was a pleasant fertile spot , well wooded , and rich in pasture . </s>', '<s> after winding along it for more than a mile , they reached their own house . </s>', '<s> a small green court was the whole of its demesne in front ; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it . </s>', '<s> as a house , barton cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles . </s>', '<s> a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind . </s>', '<s> on each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs . </s>', '<s> four bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house . </s>', '<s> it had not been built many years and was in good repair . </s>', '<s> in comparison of norland , it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away . </s>', '<s> they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy . </s>', '<s> it was very early in september ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation . </s>', '<s> the situation of the house was good . </s>', '<s> high hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody . </s>', '<s> the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . </s>', '<s> the prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . </s>', '<s> the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . </s>', '<s> with the size and furniture of the house mrs. dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . </s>', '<s> \" as for the house itself , to be sure , \" said she , \" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . </s>', '<s> perhaps in the spring , if i have plenty of money , as i dare say i shall , we may think about building . </s>', '<s> these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here ; and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . </s>', '<s> i could wish the stairs were handsome . </s>', '<s> but one must not expect every thing ; though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . </s>', '<s> i shall see how much i am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . \" </s>', '<s> in the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . </s>', \"<s> marianne 's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and elinor 's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . </s>\", '<s> in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . </s>', '<s> sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty . </s>', '<s> he had formerly visited at stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . </s>', '<s> his countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . </s>', '<s> their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . </s>', '<s> he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence . </s>', '<s> his kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . </s>', '<s> he insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day . </s>', '<s> lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on mrs. dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ so shy before company . _ ] </s>', '<s> they were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes . </s>', '<s> lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful . </s>', \"<s> her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . </s>\", '<s> but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by showing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark . </s>', '<s> conversation however was not wanted , for sir john was very chatty , and lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home . </s>', '<s> on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . </s>', '<s> in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others . </s>', '<s> an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as sir john would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day . </s>', '<s> barton park was about half a mile from the cottage . </s>', '<s> the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . </s>', '<s> the house was large and handsome ; and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . </s>', \"<s> the former was for sir john 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady . </s>\", '<s> they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . </s>', '<s> it was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . </s>', '<s> sir john was a sportsman , lady middleton a mother . </s>', '<s> he hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources . </s>', \"<s> lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while sir john 's independent employments were in existence only half the time . </s>\", '<s> continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of sir john , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife . </s>', '<s> lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . </s>', \"<s> but sir john 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . </s>\", '<s> he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , </s>', '<s> for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen . </s>', '<s> the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at barton . </s>', '<s> the miss dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . </s>', '<s> it was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . </s>', '<s> the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . </s>', '<s> in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john , who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . </s>', '<s> they would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . </s>', '<s> he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . </s>', '<s> he had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . </s>', \"<s> luckily lady middleton 's mother had arrived at barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . </s>\", '<s> the young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . </s>', \"<s> mrs. jennings , lady middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . </s>\", '<s> she was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . </s>', \"<s> marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as mrs. jennings 's . </s>\", \"<s> colonel brandon , the friend of sir john , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than lady middleton was to be his wife , or mrs. jennings to be lady middleton 's mother . </s>\", '<s> he was silent and grave . </s>', '<s> his appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike . </s>', '<s> there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his mother - in - law was interesting . </s>', '<s> lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves . </s>', '<s> in the evening , as marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . </s>', \"<s> the instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it . </s>\", \"<s> marianne 's performance was highly applauded . </s>\", '<s> sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . </s>', \"<s> lady middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked marianne to sing a particular song which marianne had just finished . </s>\", '<s> colonel brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . </s>', '<s> he paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . </s>', '<s> his pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . </s>', \"<s> she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required . </s>\", '<s> mrs. jennings was a widow with an ample jointure . </s>', '<s> she had only two daughters , both of whom she had lived to see respectably married , and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world . </s>', '<s> in the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance . </s>', '<s> she was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood . </s>', \"<s> she rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again . </s>\", '<s> it must be so . </s>', '<s> she was perfectly convinced of it . </s>', '<s> it would be an excellent match , for _ he _ was rich , and _ she _ was handsome . </s>', '<s> mrs. jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married , ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl . </s>', '<s> the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable , for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both . </s>', '<s> at the park she laughed at the colonel , and in the cottage at marianne . </s>', \"<s> to the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel 's advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor . </s>\", '<s> mrs. dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear mrs. jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age . </s>', '<s> \" but at least , mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . </s>', '<s> colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs. jennings , but he is old enough to be _ my _ father ;

and the two girls set off together . </s>\", '<s> they gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations . </s>', '<s> \" is there a felicity in the world , \" said marianne , \" superior to this?--margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . \" </s>', '<s> margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face . </s>', '<s> chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house . </s>', '<s> one consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,--it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate . </s>', '<s> they set off . </s>', '<s> marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . </s>', '<s> a gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne , when her accident happened . </s>', '<s> he put down his gun and ran to her assistance . </s>', '<s> she had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand . </s>', '<s> the gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . </s>', '<s> then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . </s>', '<s> elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . </s>', '<s> had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of mrs. dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings . </s>', '<s> she thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . </s>', '<s> this he declined , as he was dirty and wet . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . </s>', '<s> his name , he replied , was willoughby , and his present home was at allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood . </s>', '<s> the honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . </s>', '<s> his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions . </s>', '<s> marianne herself had seen less of his person than the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . </s>', '<s> but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . </s>', '<s> his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . </s>', '<s> every circumstance belonging to him was interesting . </s>', '<s> his name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming . </s>', '<s> her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . </s>', \"<s> sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham . </s>\", '<s> \" willoughby ! \" cried sir john ; \" what , is _ he _ in the country ? </s>', '<s> that is good news however ;

and he told them that mr. willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , \" yes , yes , he is very well worth catching i can tell you , miss dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides ; and if i were you , i would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . </s>', '<s> miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . </s>', '<s> brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not believe , \" said mrs. dashwood , with a good humoured smile , \" that mr. willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of _ my _ daughters towards what you call _ catching him . </s>', '<s> _ it is not an employment to which they have been brought up . </s>', '<s> men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . </s>', '<s> i am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . \" </s>', '<s> \" he is as good a sort of fellow , i believe , as ever lived , \" repeated sir john . </s>', '<s> \" i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o\\'clock till four , without once sitting down . \" </s>', '<s> \" did he indeed ? \" cried marianne with sparkling eyes , \" and with elegance , with spirit ? \" </s>', '<s> yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is what i like ; that is what a young man ought to be . </s>', '<s> whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . \" </s>', '<s> \" aye , aye , i see how it will be , \" said sir john , \" i see how it will be . </s>', '<s> you will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor brandon . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is an expression , sir john , \" said marianne , warmly , \" which i particularly dislike . </s>', \"<s> i abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ;

with a kindness which sir john 's account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him . </s>\", '<s> of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced . </s>', '<s> miss dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure . </s>', '<s> marianne was still handsomer . </s>', \"<s> her form , though not so correct as her sister 's , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common ca nt of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens . </s>\", '<s> her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardily be seen without delight . </s>', '<s> from willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created . </s>', '<s> but when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay . </s>', '<s> it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk . </s>', '<s> she could not be silent when such points were introduced , and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion . </s>', '<s> they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual , and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either . </s>', '<s> encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before . </s>', '<s> their taste was strikingly alike . </s>', '<s> the same books , the same passages were idolized by each ; or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed . </s>', '<s> he acquiesced in all her decisions , caught all her enthusiasm ; and long before his visit concluded , they conversed with the familiarity of a long - established acquaintance . </s>', '<s> \" well , marianne , \" said elinor , as soon as he had left them , \" for _ one _ morning </s>', '<s> i think you have done pretty well . </s>', \"<s> you have already ascertained mr. willoughby 's opinion in almost every matter of importance . </s>\", '<s> you know what he thinks of cowper and scott ;

i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful:--had i talked only of the weather and the roads , and had i spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . \" </s>', '<s> \" my love , \" said her mother , \" you must not be offended with elinor -- she was only in jest . </s>', '<s> i should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . </s>', '<s> marianne was softened in a moment . </s>', '<s> willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer . </s>', '<s> he came to them every day . </s>', \"<s> to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by marianne 's perfect recovery . </s>\", '<s> she was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome . </s>', '<s> willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners . </s>', \"<s> he was exactly formed to engage marianne 's heart , for with all this , he joined not only a captivating person , but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own , and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else . </s>\", '<s> his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment . </s>', '<s> they read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted . </s>', \"<s> in mrs. dashwood 's estimation he was as faultless as in marianne 's ; and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . </s>\", '<s> in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety , he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support . </s>', '<s> marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable . </s>', '<s> willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period , as capable of attaching her ; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest , as his abilities were strong . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ they sang together . _ ] </s>', '<s> her mother too , in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised , by his prospect of riches , was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it ; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons - in - law as edward and willoughby . </s>', \"<s> colonel brandon 's partiality for marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them . </s>\", '<s> their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival ; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose , was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility . </s>', '<s> elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which mrs. jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr. willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon . </s>', '<s> she saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ? </s>', '<s> and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . </s>', '<s> she liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest . </s>', '<s> his manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper . </s>', '<s> sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion . </s>', '<s> perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits . </s>', '<s> \" brandon is just the kind of man , \" said willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , \" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is exactly what i think of him , \" cried marianne . </s>', '<s> \" do not boast of it , however , \" said elinor , \" for it is injustice in both of you . </s>', '<s> he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . \" </s>', '<s> \" that he is patronised by _ you _ , \" replied willoughby , \" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . </s>', '<s> who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs. jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? \" </s>', '<s> \" but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother . </s>', '<s> if their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . \" </s>', '<s> in defence of your _ protege _ you can even be saucy . \" </s>', '<s> \" my _ protege _ , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . </s>', '<s> yes , marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . </s>', '<s> he has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . </s>', '<s> i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is to say , \" cried marianne contemptuously , \" he has told you , that in the east indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . \" </s>', '<s> \" he _ would _ have told me so , i doubt not , had i made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps , \" said willoughby , \" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . \" </s>', '<s> \" i may venture to say that _ his _ observations have stretched much further than _ your _ candour . </s>', '<s> but why should you dislike him ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not dislike him . </s>', '<s> i consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body \\'s good word , and nobody \\'s notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . \" </s>', '<s> \" add to which , \" cried marianne , \" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . </s>', '<s> that his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . \" </s>', '<s> \" you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , \" replied elinor , \" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . </s>', '<s> i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , i believe , possessing an amiable heart . \" </s>', '<s> \" miss dashwood , \" cried willoughby , \" you are now using me unkindly . </s>', '<s> you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . </s>', '<s> but it will not do . </s>', '<s> you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . </s>', '<s> i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon ; he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and i can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . </s>', '<s> if it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , i am ready to confess it . </s>', '<s> and in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . \" </s>', '<s> little had mrs. dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . </s>', '<s> yet such was the case . </s>', '<s> when marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which sir john had been previously forming , were put into execution . </s>', '<s> the private balls at the park then began ; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow . </s>', '<s> in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection . </s>', '<s> elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . </s>', '<s> she only wished that it were less openly shown ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to marianne . </s>', '<s> but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions . </s>', '<s> willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions . </s>', '<s> when he was present she had no eyes for any one else . </s>', '<s> every thing he did , was right . </s>', '<s> every thing he said , was clever . </s>', '<s> if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . </s>', '<s> if dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . </s>', '<s> such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . </s>', '<s> to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind . </s>', '<s> this was the season of happiness to marianne . </s>', '<s> her heart was devoted to willoughby , and the fond attachment to norland , which she brought with her from sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home . </s>', \"<s> elinor 's happiness was not so great . </s>\", '<s> her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . </s>', '<s> they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever . </s>', '<s> neither lady middleton nor mrs. jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . </s>', \"<s> she had already repeated her own history to elinor three or four times ; and had elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr. jennings 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . </s>\", '<s> lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . </s>', '<s> elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . </s>', '<s> towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . </s>', '<s> she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . </s>', '<s> her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ; and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . </s>', '<s> in colonel brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . </s>', '<s> willoughby was out of the question . </s>', \"<s> her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . </s>\", '<s> colonel brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of marianne , and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . </s>', \"<s> elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . </s>\", '<s> this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . </s>', '<s> his eyes were fixed on marianne , and , </s>', '<s> after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , \" your sister , i understand , does not approve of second attachments . \" </s>', '<s> \" no , \" replied elinor , \" her opinions are all romantic . \" </s>', '<s> \" or rather , as i believe , she considers them impossible to exist . \" </s>', '<s> \" i believe she does . </s>', '<s> but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , i know not . </s>', '<s> a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . \" </s>', '<s> \" this will probably be the case , \" he replied ; \" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . \" </s>', '<s> \" i can not agree with you there , \" said elinor . </s>', '<s> \" there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne \\'s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . </s>', '<s> her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . \" </s>', '<s> after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying-- </s>', '<s> \" does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? </s>', '<s> are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? \" </s>', '<s> \" upon my word , i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . </s>', '<s> i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment \\'s being pardonable . \" </s>', '<s> \" this , \" said he , \" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- no , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! </s>', '<s> i speak from experience . </s>', '<s> i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances-- \" here he stopped suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered elinor \\'s head . </s>', '<s> the lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . </s>', '<s> as it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . </s>', '<s> elinor attempted no more . </s>', '<s> but marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . </s>', '<s> the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love . </s>', \"<s> as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne 's imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . </s>\", '<s> marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . </s>', \"<s> without considering that it was not in her mother 's plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures . </s>\", '<s> \" he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it , \" she added , \" and when it arrives we will ride every day . </s>', '<s> you shall share its use with me . </s>', '<s> imagine to yourself , my dear elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . \" </s>', '<s> most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . </s>', '<s> as to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for _ him _ ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . </s>', '<s> elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . </s>', '<s> this was too much . </s>', '<s> \" you are mistaken , elinor , \" said she warmly , \" in supposing i know very little of willoughby . </s>', '<s> i have not known him long indeed , but i am much better acquainted with him , than i am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . </s>', '<s> it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; it is disposition alone . </s>', '<s> seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . </s>', '<s> i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from willoughby . </s>', '<s> of john i know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed . \" </s>', '<s> elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more . </s>', \"<s> she knew her sister 's temper . </s>\", '<s> opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . </s>', '<s> but by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined . </s>', '<s> she was faithful to her word ; and when willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . </s>', '<s> the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . </s>', '<s> his concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice , \" </s>', '<s> but , marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . </s>', '<s> i shall keep it only till you can claim it . </s>', '<s> when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , queen mab shall receive you . \" </s>', '<s> this was all overheard by miss dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . </s>', '<s> from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . </s>', '<s> margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . </s>', '<s> willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves . </s>', '<s> \" oh , elinor ! \" she cried , \" i have such a secret to tell you about marianne . </s>', '<s> i am sure she will be married to mr. willoughby very soon . \" </s>', '<s> \" you have said so </s>', '<s> , \" replied elinor , \" almost every day since they first met on high - church down ;

and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . \" </s>', '<s> for such particulars , stated on such authority , elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself . </s>', \"<s> margaret 's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister . </s>\", '<s> when mrs. jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was elinor \\'s particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , \" i must not tell , may i , elinor ? \" </s>', '<s> this of course made every body laugh ; and elinor tried to laugh too . </s>', '<s> but the effort was painful . </s>', '<s> she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs. jennings . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ he cut off a long lock of her hair . _ ] </s>', '<s> marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret-- </s>', '<s> \" remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . \" </s>', '<s> \" i never had any conjectures about it , \" replied margaret ; \" it was you who told me of it yourself . \" </s>', '<s> this increased the mirth of the company , and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more . </s>', '<s> \" oh ! pray , miss margaret , let us know all about it , \" said mrs. jennings . </s>', '<s> what is the gentleman \\'s name ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i must not tell , ma\\'am . </s>', '<s> but i know very well what it is ;

and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . </s>', '<s> willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . </s>', '<s> but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . </s>', '<s> a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of colonel brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . </s>', '<s> the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and sir john , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . </s>', \"<s> they contained a noble piece of water -- a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . </s>\", '<s> to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight ; and mrs. dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by elinor to stay at home . </s>', '<s> their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor had expected . </s>', '<s> she was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all . </s>', \"<s> by ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . </s>\", '<s> the morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . </s>', '<s> they were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise . </s>', '<s> while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in . </s>', '<s> among the rest there was one for colonel brandon:--he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room . </s>', '<s> \" what is the matter with brandon ? \" said sir john . </s>', '<s> nobody could tell . </s>', '<s> \" i hope he has had no bad news , \" said lady middleton . </s>', '<s> \" it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . \" </s>', '<s> in about five minutes he returned . </s>', '<s> \" no bad news , colonel , i hope ; \" said mrs. jennings , as soon as he entered the room . </s>', '<s> \" none at all , ma\\'am , i thank you . \" </s>', '<s> \" was it from avignon ? </s>', '<s> i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . \" </s>', '<s> \" no , ma\\'am . </s>', '<s> it came from town , and is merely a letter of business . \" </s>', '<s> \" but how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? come , come , this wo n\\'t do , colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . \" </s>', '<s> \" my dear madam , \" said lady middleton , \" recollect what you are saying . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married ? \" said mrs. jennings , without attending to her daughter \\'s reproof . </s>', '<s> \" no , indeed , it is not . \" </s>', '<s> \" well , then , i know who it is from , colonel . </s>', '<s> and i hope she is well . \" </s>', '<s> \" whom do you mean , ma\\'am ? \" said he , colouring a little . </s>', '<s> \" oh ! you know who i mean . \" </s>', '<s> \" i am particularly sorry , ma\\'am , \" said he , addressing lady middleton , \" that i should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . \" </s>', '<s> \" in town ! \" cried mrs. jennings . </s>', '<s> \" what can you have to do in town at this time of year ? \" </s>', '<s> my own loss is great , \" he continued , \" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ;

but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable . </s>', '<s> well , then , when will you come back again ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i hope we shall see you at barton , \" added her ladyship , \" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ;

and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . </s>', '<s> \" i can guess what his business is , however , \" said mrs. jennings exultingly . </s>', '<s> \" can you , ma\\'am ? \" said almost every body . </s>', '<s> \" yes ; it is about miss williams , i am sure . \" </s>', '<s> \" and who is miss williams ? \" asked marianne . </s>', '<s> \" what ! do not you know who miss williams is ? </s>', '<s> i am sure you must have heard of her before . </s>', \"<s> she is a relation of the colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . </s>\", '<s> we will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . \" </s>', '<s> then , lowering her voice a little , she said to elinor , \" she is his natural daughter . \" </s>', '<s> \" indeed ! \" </s>', '<s> \" oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . </s>', '<s> i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune . \" </s>', '<s> when sir john returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . </s>', \"<s> the carriages were then ordered ; willoughby 's was first , and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . </s>\", '<s> he drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . </s>', '<s> they both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . </s>', '<s> it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long . </s>', '<s> some more of the careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which sir john observed with great contentment . </s>', '<s> willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods . </s>', '<s> mrs. jennings sat on elinor \\'s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and willoughby , and said to marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , \" i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . </s>', '<s> i know where you spent the morning . \" </s>', '<s> marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , \" where , pray ? \" </s>', '<s> \" did not you know , \" said willoughby , \" that we had been out in my curricle ? \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , yes , mr. impudence , i know that very well , and i was determined to find out _ where _ you had been to . </s>', '<s> i hope you like your house , miss marianne . </s>', '<s> it is a very large one , i know ; and when i come to see you , i hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago . \" </s>', '<s> marianne turned away in great confusion . </s>', \"<s> mrs. jennings laughed heartily ; and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr. willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . </s>\", '<s> elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose , or marianne consent , to enter the house while mrs. smith was in it , with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . </s>', '<s> as soon as they left the dining - room , elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs. jennings was perfectly true . </s>', '<s> marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it . </s>', '<s> \" why should you imagine , elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? </s>', '<s> is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? \" </s>', '<s> yes , marianne , but i would not go while mrs. smith was there , and with no other companion than mr. willoughby . \" </s>', '<s> [ illustration : \" _ i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . _ \" ] </s>', '<s> \" mr. willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . </s>', '<s> i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . \" </s>', '<s> \" i am afraid , \" replied elinor , \" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . \" </s>', '<s> \" on the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did , i should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure . \" </s>', '<s> \" but , my dear marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? \" </s>', '<s> \" if the impertinent remarks of mrs. jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . </s>', '<s> i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation . </s>', \"<s> i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs. smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . </s>\", '<s> they will one day be mr. willoughby \\'s , and-- \" </s>', '<s> if they were one day to be your own , marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . \" </s>', '<s> she blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes \\' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , \" perhaps , elinor , it _ was _ rather ill - judged in me to go to allenham ; but mr. willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , i assure you . </s>', '<s> there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . </s>', '<s> it is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . </s>', '<s> on one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . </s>', '<s> i did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture ; but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in england . \" </s>', '<s> could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight . </s>']\n"
